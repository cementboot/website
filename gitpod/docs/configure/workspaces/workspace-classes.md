# Workspace classes

Workspace classes allow you to select the resources available to your workspaces.

On gitpod.io, the options are:

- **Standard**: up to 4 cores, up to 8GB RAM, 30GB storage
- **Large**: up to 8 cores, up to 16GB RAM, 50GB storage

You can override the default (Standard) workspace class in the [Gitpod project](/docs/configure/projects) settings for your repository.

## Select a workspace class for your workspace

You can select workspace class directly from [Gitpod Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). You can do that from by clicking on the `New Workspace` button. Then, you can select the [context url](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url) and [Editor](/docs/references/ides-and-editors).

## Good to know

- Large workspace classes use [credits](/docs/configure/billing#credits) at a faster rate. Standard workspaces use 10 credits per hour, whereas Large workspaces use 20 credits per hour.
- [Prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) currently use the same workspace class as regular workspaces.

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

Create a team [project](/docs/configure/projects) on Gitpod, from the project settings you can select a large workspace.

### [Is it possible to build (android) AOSP source on Gitpod?](https://discord.com/channels/816244985187008514/1055454782908792843)

<!-- DISCORD_BOT_FAQ - DO NOT REMOVE -->

It is not quite feasible to build an entire AOSP tree right now due to current storage capacity limitations. Please react with a "üëç" on https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/13950 and comment your requirements.
