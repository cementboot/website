# Organization plans

> The organization plans below have been superseded by our [new billing model](/docs/configure/billing).

> This page is for users who are looking to manage or cancel their existing organization plans.

Organization plans allow you to pay for your whole organization with a single subscription.

Organization plans are accessed from [gitpod.io/orgs/](https://gitpod.io/orgs/) in your user settings.

You can choose between the **Organization Professional** plan, or the **Organization Unleashed** plan, and you can specify how many seats you want for each organization. Each member of the Organization Plan will then be able to use Gitpod as if they had purchased their own Professional or Unleashed plan.

Once the payment process is complete, you can manage organization members, add more organization seats, and also invite organization members using a unique public URL.

You can either directly assign a seat by entering your organization member's GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket username, or use the `Invite Members` link from the more actions button to get a shareable link. Send the link to your organization so they can claim a seat.

## Good to know

- You won't be assigned to a seat in your new organization plan when it is first created. Add yourself just like other members.
- If you add seats in the middle of a monthly billing period, you will be charged for the whole period.
