# Organization billing

> The plans below have been superseded by our [new billing model](/docs/configure/billing).

> This page is for users who are looking to manage or cancel their existing organization billing plans.

Organization billing allows you to pay for your whole organization with a single subscription. You can choose between the **Organization Professional** plan, or the **Organization Unleashed** plan.

With Organization billing, all plan seats will be managed automatically, by auto-subscribing new members, and unsubscribing members who leave.

Organization billing can be accessed under Organization Settings if you are an organization owner.

Once a plan is active, Organization billing will auto-subscribe new members, and the count will update automatically.

Look for the green button to manage your payment details or to cancel your subscription.

## Good to know

- an organization can only have one active Organization billing plan.
- With Organization billing, all organization members, including owners, are auto-subscribed to the plan.
- New members are added using a shared [invite URL](/docs/configure/orgs#add-members-to-a-organization) which can be reset.
- When new members join in the middle of a billing period, you will be billed pro-rata for the remaining fraction of the month.
- See [Organizations & Projects](/docs/configure) to create a new Organization.
